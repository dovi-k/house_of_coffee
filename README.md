### Design
#### Framework
- [Bootstrap](https://www.bootstrapcdn.com/), front-end framework is chosen for this project for its modern interface, ease of use and ability to be easily customized. It is used for creating features such as navbar, cards, forms, modals, as well as for the layout.
- [JQuery](https://jquery.com/) is used for initializing some Bootstrap components, as well as for custom functions, DOM manipulation.
#### Colour Scheme



 
![Color Palette]()
#### Typography
There are three fonts used across the project that I find a good combination: 
- [Megrim](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Megrim) used as the main body and LOGO font, popular modern cursive typeface providing lovely and modern visual feel. However, I Slightly overused it I believe in the project and I should have used more fonts and dofferent fonts for example important things like check out, user profile form to increase readability.

#### Icons
Icons are great way to make the website look more user friendly and grab the attention to the details. They allow users to find and scan content quickly and easily. It also helps people who are non-native English speaker to easier scan and gives visual clues about the content as well as creating more user friendly experience.  
- [FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com/) is used in my project as main main icon library across the project (e.g. for social media links, to display categories, forms, cart, search and user icons in navigation).

### Wireframes
[Balsamiq Wireframes](https://balsamiq.com/) tool was used to create all wireframes for this project.   

Original wireframes for desktop, tablet and mobile can be found [here](documentation/wireframes).

## Features
Art of Tea website is composed of applications: `product`, `home`, `bag`, `checkout`, `profiles`, `about`
### Existing Features     
#### Navbar
I have selected to keep the Navbar Fixed for users to be able to navigate the site easier reaching their Account, Products, Shopping Bag in one or two clicks.
 The **logo** is located in the top left corner on a desktop and more centered on smaller devices.
 It redirects a user to the home/landing page when clicked. On smaller resolutions (tablet, mobile) 
 the navbar is collapsed into a burger icon. Menu links appear when the burger icon is clicked and collapse back, when clicked again.    
 
Navbar also contains a **search box**, users can type in a wrd and it will give them selection of items that contain that word in their name or category.     
**Cart icon** is a very import one, siplayed on the right side of the nav bar, it displayes grand total for the duration of the session.
 


#### Footer
 - <img src="" alt="footer" target="_blank" rel="noopener" width="850">    
 
Footer is still wokr in progress. 

Once footer is completed I will update more information of what it includes, the plan is to have it stuck to the bottom of the page and displayed across all the screens. It should contain **social media icon-links** which redirect a user to the corresponding page, opening in a new tab. GitHub and LinkedIn icons open author of the project's profile, while Instagram and Facebook will be opening icons open the main pages, as it is not the real company.   


#### Landing (home) page
 - <img src="" alt="landing_page" target="_blank" rel="noopener" width="850">
The landing page serves to attract new users to the business, to give a clear understanding about that and to attract users to use the website's functionality to shop. 
- **Hero image** is of perfect FlatWhite coffe cup with a beautiful LatteArt engages the visual sense.

## Information Architecture
### Database choice
During the development phase I worked with **sqlite3** database which is installed with Django.   
For deployment(production), a **PostgreSQL** database is provided by Heroku as an add-on.
- The **User model** used in this project is provided by Django as a part of defaults `django.contrib.auth.models`. More information about Django’s authentication system can be found [here](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/ref/contrib/auth/).

## Deployment
HOUSE OF COFFEE project was developed using the [GitPod](https://www.gitpod.io/) online IDE and
using Git & GitHub for version control. It is hosted on the [Heroku](https://heroku.com/) platform.
### Local Deployment
The following tools have to be installed for the project to run:
- An IDE of your choice (I used [GitPod](https://www.gitpod.io/) for creating this project)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [PIP](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/) 
- [Python3](https://www.python.org/download/releases/3.0/)    

Creating accounts with the following services:
- [Stripe](https://stripe.com/en-ie)
- [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/) to setup the [S3 basket](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/gsg/CreatingABucket.html)
- [Gmail](https://mail.google.com/)



#### Directions
1. You can clone this repository directly into the editor of your choice by pasting the following command into the terminal:   
`https://github.com/dovi-k/house_of_coffee/`    
Alternatively, you can save a copy of this repository by clicking the green button **Clone or download** , then **Download Zip** button, and after extract the Zip file to your folder.      
In the terminal window of your local IDE change the directory (CD) to the correct file location (directory that you have just created).       

Note: You can read more information about the cloning process on the [GitHub Help page](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository).   

2. Set up environment variables.     
Note, that this process will be different depending on IDE you use.   
In this it was done using the following way:      
    - Create `.env` file in the root directory.
    - Add `.env` to the `.gitignore` file in your project's root directory
    - In `.env` file set environment variables with the following syntax:     
    ```bash 
    import os  
    os.environ["DEVELOPMENT"] = "True"    
    os.environ["SECRET_KEY"] = "<Your Secret key>"    
    os.environ["STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY"] = "<Your Stripe Public key>"    
    os.environ["STRIPE_SECRET_KEY"] = "<Your Stripe Secret key>"    
    os.environ["STRIPE_WH_SECRET"] = "<Your Stripe WH_Secret key>"    
    os.environ["GOOGLE_MAP_KEY"] = "<Your Google Map key>" 
     ```
       
Read more about how to set up the Stripe keys in the [Stripe Documentation](https://stripe.com/docs/keys)
    
3. Install all requirements from the **requirements.txt** file putting this command into your terminal:     
`pip3 install -r requirements.txt`     
4. In the terminal in your IDE migrate the models to crete a database using the following commands:    
`python3 manage.py makemigrations`     
`python3 manage.py migrate`     
5. Load the data fixtures(**categories**, **products**, **itinerary**, **itinerary_items**, **events**) in that order into the database using the following command:    
`python3 manage.py loaddata <fixture_name>`        
6. Create a superuser to have an access to the the admin panel(you need to follow the instructions then and insert username,email and password):    
`python3 manage.py createsuperuser`   
7. You will now be able to run the application using the following command:     
`python3 manage.py runserver`     
8. To access the admin panel, you can add the `/admin` path at the end of the url link and login using your superuser credentials.

### Heroku Deployment
*To start Heroku Deployment process, you need to clone the project as described in the [Local deployment](#local-deployment) section above.*     
To deploy the project to [Heroku](https://heroku.com/) the following steps need to be completed:    
1. Create a **requirement.txt** file, which contains a list of the dependencies, using the following command in the terminal:    
`pip3 freeze > requirements.txt`    
2. Create a **Procfile**, in order to tell Heroku how to run the project, using the following command in the terminal:      
`web: gunicorn house-of-coffee.wsgi:application`    
3. `git add`, `git commit` and `git push` these files to GitHub repository.     
NOTE: these 1-3 steps already done in this project and included in the GitHub repository, but illistrated here as they are required for the successfull deployment to Heroku.        
As well as that, other things that are required for the Heroku deployment and have to be installed: **gunicorn** (WSGI HTTP Server), **dj-database-url** for database connection and **Psycopg** (PostgreSQL driver for Python). All of the mentioned above are *already installed* in this project in the requirements.txt file.     
4. On the [Heroku](https://heroku.com/) website you need to create a **new app**, assigne a name (must be unique),set a region to the closest to you(for my project I set Europe) and click **Create app**.   
5. Go to **Resources** tab in Heroku, then in the **Add-ons** search bar look for **Heorku Postgres**(you can type `postgres`), select **Hobby Dev — Free** and click **Provision** button to add it to your project.     
6. In Heroku **Settings** click on **Reveal Config Vars**.   
7. Set the following config variables there:     

| KEY            | VALUE         |
|----------------|---------------|
| AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID | `<your aws access key>`  |
| AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY | `<your aws secret access key>`  |
| DATABASE_URL| `<your postgres database url>`  |
| EMAIL_HOST_PASS | `<your email password(generated by Gmail)>` |
| EMAIL_HOST_USER| `<your email address>`  |
| GOOGLE_MAP_KEY| `<your google map key>`  |
| SECRET_KEY | `<your secret key>`  |
| STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY| `<your stripe public key>`  |
| STRIPE_SECRET_KEY| `<your stripe secret key>`  |
| STRIPE_WH_SECRET| `<your stripe wh key>`  |
| USE_AWS | `True`  |


     
8. Copy **DATABASE_URL's value**(Postrgres database URL) from the Convig Vars and temporary paste it into the default database in **settings.py**.     
You can temporary comment out the current database settings code and just paste the following in the settings.py:   
```bash 
  DATABASES = {     
        'default': dj_database_url.parse("<your Postrgres database URL here>")     
    }
  ```
Important Note: that's just temporary set up, this URL **should not be committed and published to GitHub** for security reasons, so make sure not to commit your changes to Git while the URL is in the settings.py.     
9. Migrate the database models to the Postgres database using the following commands in the terminal:    
`python3 manage.py makemigrations`     
`python3 manage.py migrate`     
10. Load the data fixtures(**categories**, **products**, **itinerary**, **itinerary_items**, **events**) into the  Postgres database using the following command:     
`python3 manage.py loaddata <fixture_name>`      
11. Create a **superuser** for the Postgres database by running the following command(*you need to follow the instructions and inserting username,email and password*):      
`python3 manage.py createsuperuser`     
12. You need to remove your Postgres URL database from the settings and uncomment the default DATABASE settings code in the settings.py file.    
Note: for production you get the environment variable 'DATABASE_URL' from the Heroku Config Vars and use Postgress database, while for development you use the SQLite as a default database.     
13. Add your Heroku app URL to **ALLOWED_HOSTS** in the settings.py file.
14. You can connect Heroku to GitHub to automatically deploy each time you push to GitHub.    
To do so, from the Heroku dashboard follow the steps:
-  **Deploy** section -> **Deployment method** -> select **GitHub**
-  link the Heroku app to your GitHub repository for this project
- click **Enable Automatic Deploys** in the Automatic Deployment section
- Run `git push` command in the terminal, that would now push your code to both Github and Heroku, and perform the deployment.     

Alternatively, in the terminal you can run:    
- `heroku login`    
-  after adding and comitting to Git, run the following command:     
`git push heroku master`
15. After successful deployment, you can view your app bu clicking **Open App** on Heroku platform.
16. You will also need to verify your email address, so you need to login with your superuser credentials and verify your email address in the admin panel. Now you will be able to view the app running!    
##### Hosting media files with AWS
The **static files** and **media files** (that will be uploaded by superuser - product/service images) are hosted in the [AWS S3 Bucket](https://aws.amazon.com/). To host them, you need to create an account in AWS and create your S3 basket with *public access*. More about setting it up you can read in [Amazon S3 documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/gsg/CreatingABucket.html) and [this tutorial](https://django-storages.readthedocs.io/en/latest/backends/amazon-S3.html).
##### Senging email via Gmail
In order to send real emails from the application, you need to connect it to your **Gmail account**, setting up your **email address** in EMAIL_HOST_USER variable and your **app password** generated by your email provider in EMAIL_HOST_PASS variable.
